Kent Kendo Club attended the 37th Annual Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation Taikai on 28 October, 2023 at the Kent Commons Community Center. A total of 8 members participated, including 6 juniors and 2 adults. The kid's team was younger and more inexperienced than most, but still fought hard aginst the odds!
