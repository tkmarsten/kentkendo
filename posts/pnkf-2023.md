Kent Kendo Club attended the 37th Annual Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation Taikai on 28 October, 2023 at the Kent Commons Community Center. A total of 8 members participated, including 6 juniors and 2 adults. The kid's team was younger and more inexperienced than most, but still fought hard against the odds! Unfortunately, we did not walk away with any trophies this time, but will keep working hard to change that for next year.
